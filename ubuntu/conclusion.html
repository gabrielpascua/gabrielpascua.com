                    When I set out to install Ubuntu, I was not planning on writing about my experience.  I hated
                    the many workarounds getting open source technology to work on Windows so I want to
                    have a dedicated OS for it.  I can't afford a Macbook Pro so Linux is the way to go.  All in all I spent
                    almost a week configuring the computer and I did not want my efforts to go to waste.  I knew it will
                    require work but I was willing to put time learning something new.  What I did not expect was
                    the slew of issues I encountered one after another.

                    I did not give up on fixing every problem that arise.  After the 4th day, I noticed I was getting good at
                    using Ubuntu.  I think I could pass as an average 
                    user - keyboard shortcuts here and there, switching workspaces, running terminal commands,
                    and re-arranging root files.  Considering 14.04 was released October 2011, I think it was way ahead
                    of Windows 7 on features at that time.

                    I now get why a lot of developers are drawn to it.  It's very fast when it works and it does not distract
                    you from so many features you wouldn't need. One caveat I think is you have to have development experience to
                    appreciate it.  I don't think an average user will be able to handle the configurability and the hardware
                    incompatibilities that come with the OS.  It's a system that encourages fewer mouse clicks.

                    I want to relate this whole thing to my Android Nexus experience or just using a rooted phone.  Ridding the bloat and running vanilla
                    software was an eye opener.  For the average user, the Mac and iPhone experiences are along the same lines.
                    They work out of the box, there are no junks, and the features are not distracting.  I wish every tech or gadget 
                    company would move towards this direction because I know there are a lot of consumers out there
                    wishing the same.

                    Would I move away from Microsoft development? Unlikely.  What I want to do is offer a business advice   
                    to Microsoft - build a developer-friendly PC.  Collaborate with any of your hardware partners and build a vanilla
                    Windows that can get us running code quickly without going through endless service
                    pack updates.   Make it platform-agnostic too.  And since it's already a huge ask, might as well throw a free Visual Studio 
                    Pro with it.
