            <h1>Up and Running with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</h1>

            <p>
            I recently bought a Dell Inspiron I7548-7130SLV PC and decided to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 10.
            I have no prior Linux experience and the only knowledge I have with any Unix
            OS are the things I picked up while building websites on a Mac.  My goal was to be able to use my
            own laptop for work when I'm at home during emergencies.  At the time of this
            writing 4K displays are not widely used on laptops and I'm fully aware
            of the challenges that early adoption brings.
            </p>

            <p>
            I have a web development work background. I've been an ASP.NET developer for most of 
            my career but my changing of departments veered my coding platform towards open source
            technologies - specifically PHP, MySql, Node and Postgres. We're using MAMP Pro at work
            so I have to prepare myself on the laborious process of manually setting up my sites.
            I intend to get all my office code running on a local apache environment on a very 
            optimistic timeline of 3 days.
            </p>

            <p>
            I thought it was going to be an easy setup but it was the complete opposite. I've
            spent so many days googling solutions and by the time a snippet worked, I could barely
            remember what I did several keystrokes back to revert the ones that did not work.  
            Here's my account of setting up my computer in case future me requires to get another
            hardward upgrade.
