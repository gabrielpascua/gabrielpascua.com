Preface

Much like security, the earlier you care about reliability, the better….because it’s less costly to expand a structure later on than it is to introduce one that is not present.

Bear the SRE Way in mind: thoroughness and dedication, belief in the value of preparation and documentation, and an awareness of what could go wrong, coupled with a strong desire to prevent it.
