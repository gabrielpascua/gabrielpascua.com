### What it is
Edge computing is a family of technologies that bring compute, storage and networking capabilities closest to its intelligent (IOT) sources and subsequently their users. It moves computing services and data away data centers (Multi Cloud) to the "Edge of Network".  It is also referred at times as "Fog Computing" to illustrate its relationship to the Cloud.  The most common applications today are augmented reality, smart devices, and gaming.

### Cloud Computing
If Cloud Computing is Big Data, Edge Computing is Instant Data.  Edge Computing is meant to complement Cloud Computing.  30% of data in the Cloud currently are from real-time devices - live video feeds, mobile data, etc..  As more and more devices connect to the internet, the volume of data going to the cloud will continue to increase.  It is estimated that by 2025, cloud networks will have 165 ZB of data, making it unsustainable if not more expensive. 

### The Benefits
1. **Low Latency** - Because of its proximity to the source, it enables real-time data processing
2. **Decentralization of Data** - Devices with compute capabilities can filter data sent to the cloud.  This has also a positive effect on security because you can limit personal information shared to the cloud
3. **Reliable connection** - Devices that can mirror the compute processing from a cloud network can delay data synchronization in case there is a drop in network. Smart cars, planes and ships can take advantage of this as well as people in rural areas.
4. **Reduced cloud compute cost** - You will rely less on the Cloud.  By being able to choose the data you send to the Cloud, you can scale down compute and storage resources.

### 5G Networks
Because IOT Devices are the main drivers of Edge Computing, it is important that a faster network exists.  This network, together with AI and Machine Learning can bring IOT devices immediate response to the users.  Think of the safety implications if Smart Cars can react in nano seconds to real-world events, or when Healthcare Robotics can process information quickly during a procedure.  5G is projected to be 10X faster than 4G and can support up to 50X active devices within the same geographic network coverage.
